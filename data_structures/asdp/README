Project 1: The CS61B Drawing System.

The files in this directory form a skeleton that you are to flesh out
into a full system.


Files:


Makefile:      This simple Makefile does standard tasks such
               as building the application, cleaning up unneeded files, and
               running the JUnit tests.  Used as a configuration file 
               by the 'gmake' program.

draw.java:     A convenience class that simply executes the main
               method in drawing/Main.java.

PUBLIC-VERSION:
               A file containing just the name of the current public release
               version in the public/proj1/tags directory.  (Helpful when
               trying to figure out what merges to do.)

drawing (subdirectory):  The package containing the drawing system.  Putting
               all this in a package, besides avoiding those nagging messages
               from Eclipse saying that you are naughty for putting things in
               the default package, allows you to make public only those
               things that need to be (i.e., not very much).

    Makefile:  See Makefile, above.

    Main.java: Contains the main method for the system.

    Testing.java: 
               The main program here runs all your JUnit tests.  Your tests
               may be scattered over many classes, but this is a kind of
               central index of all of them, and has a few useful methods 
               for use in some tests.

    MainTests.java:
               Tests of the top-level programs.

    Command.java
    Interpreter.java
    Literal.java
    Number.java
    Picture.java
    Value.java:
               SAMPLE source files, hinting at ONE POSSIBLE implementation
               (object analysis) of the system.  An Interpreter executes
               programs, which are represented as sequences of Commands.
               One such Command is a Literal, which represents an appearance
               a decimal numeral in a program.  Executing Commands
               produces Values, which include Numbers and Pictures.  

    Display.java:
               A class that acts like a print file (such as System.out), but
               that sends its output to a running Ghostscript process
               (Ghostscript is a Postscript interpreter) so that it is 
               displayed immediately on your screen.
    Displayer.java:
               This is a utility that is NOT part of the project.  It contains
               a main program (run with 'java drawing.Displayer') that simply
	       sends all input it receives from the standard input to
               Ghostscript (using the Display class).  

drawing-tests (subdirectory): 
               Directory of test files and standard outputs for comparison.
	       Used by gmake check.

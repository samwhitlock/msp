                       The CS61B Drawing System
                      Users' Guide and Reference

                           *Sam Whitlock*

The Drawing System provides an interface to translate simple LISP expressions into their equivalent postscript output.

The following mathematical operations in LISP may be used N levels deep:
-addition
-subtraction
-multiplication
-division
-sin
-cos
-sqrt

Assignment statements may also be used 1 level deep.

Number values may be signed or unsigned integers or real numbers. The
exponential format may also be used, denoted by NeM, which translates
to N times 10 raised to the Mth power.

PostScript provides and easy way to describe shapes in an output
space. This Drawing System uses a simple version LISP to create
PostScript output. The user may "paint a picture" by creating and
translating basic shapes in a LISP representation, and the Drawing
System will parse them into PostScript and execute them if the user
desires.

When executing the Drawing System in the Java Virtual Machine, you may
use execute the program with an input file and have it write to an
output file, or, if no output file is specified, the Drawing System
will execute the LISP expression in the input file. If the "-"
character is used in either the location for the input file or for the
output file, the program will write to Standard Input or Standard
Output if it is replaces either/both (of) the arguments for the input
file or the output file.

For drawing pictures, the user has several options to work with. They
may drawing filled or unfilled circles and rectangles and
lines. Additionally, they may adjust the parameters of color and line
width to subsequent line commands (the initial color is
black). Pictures may also be moved rotates and scaled. Also included
is the control structure of the for loop.

If the Drawing System is executed without any arguments, a help dialog
describing the commands is printed out to Standard Out for the user.

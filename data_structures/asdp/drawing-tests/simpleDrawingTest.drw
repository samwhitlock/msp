;One cool feature I implemented in my program was the ability to use assignments in expressions
(+ (:= x 33) -32)
(- x 3e-4)

;I also did something pretty nifty with my number pattern, where it will truncate be exponents
-3.4e-4.5 ; This runs, even though straight Double parsing it would be an error
